1 - you can declare a variable without var keyword. But if you declare a varaible without var keyword inside a function then that varaible will become global.

HTML is case insensitive.

java script is pass by value. 




what is the execution order of java script if we have more than 1 js file.

js engine execute the code from top to bottom. it executes the code in two passes, in the first pass it reads all your function and in the second pass it begins executing your code.

can we pass any type of parameter to a function in java script?



Objects package up the complexity of your data so that you
can focus on the high level design of your code, not the nitty gritty
details. Say you want to write a traffic simulator with tens of cars;
you’ll want to focus on cars and streetlights and road objects and
not hundreds of little variables. Objects also make your life easier
because they encapsulate, or hide, the complexity of the state
and behavior of your objects so you don’t have to worry about
them. How all that works will become much clearer as you gain
experience with objects.

we can insert and delete the properties in java object.

But there’s another way: bracket notation, which looks like this:


### Document Object

Document Object contains a method getElementById then fetches the element present at that id and innerHtml property return the content.

Browser creates Document object when we load the html page. Java script can interact with the Document object to create or remove elements.

If you put your java script in the head element and try to access element in body you can get element not found error.Because, the element that you are trying to access it not created by browser.
To resolve this issue you can execute your code calling the method after window load


## Functions

function in java script will always return a value. if you do not specify the return statement then it will return undefined.



##Values

Why do we have undefined and null in java script?
undefined is used when a proprity is not defined or array object does not contain an element.
null is used to denote an object whose value cannot be computed.


##Callback

Give a function to the object that known about the event. When the event occurs, that object will call you back, or notify you, by calling that function.

#type of
type of null is an object.
type of undefined is undefined
type of NAN is a number.


and know that
it is most common to use null in places where an object should be
but one can’t be created or found, and it is most common to find
undefined when you have a variable that hasn’t been initialized, or
an object with a missing property, or an array with a missing value.

If you compare
NaN to NaN, they aren’t equal
if you want to compare nan then you have to use isNaN function



## equality



CASE#1: Comparing a number and a string.
String is coverted to a number

CASE#2: Comparing a boolean with anyother type
boolean is conveted to number

CASE#3 



##Function

This is function declration

function quack(num) {
for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
console.log("Quack!");
}


This is function expression

var fly = function(num) {
for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
console.log("Flying!");
}
};
fly(3);


}




Function declarations are evaluated
before the rest of the code is evaluated.

Function expressions get evaluated
later, with the rest of the code

That means you cannot use function expresion before it is defined.
